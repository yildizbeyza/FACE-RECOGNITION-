Face Recognition System in Python

This repository contains a segment of a Face Recognition project developed in Python, showcasing key aspects of my work on facial recognition technology. It is important to note that the full project is not disclosed here due to the confidentiality agreements with my employer, the Presidency of the Republic of TÜRKİYE Digital Transformation Office, Department of Big Data and AI. 



Also, there is a Short Report of Test Result in Files. 



Key Features:

-Implementation of advanced face detection algorithms.

-Efficient processing of live video streams for face capture.

-Sample codes demonstrating the core functionality.


Note: Due to company privacy policies, only partial code and limited documentation are available in this repository. The complete project encompasses broader functionalities and complex algorithms, which are proprietary to the Presidency of the Republic of TÜRKİYE Digital Transformation Office.
